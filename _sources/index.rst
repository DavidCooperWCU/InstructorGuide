   a heading in the table of contents. Source files that should be
   generated and included in that section should be placed on individual
   lines, with one line separating the first source filename and the

Introduction
::::::::::::

The Runestone platform allows you to create, modify, use, and serve interactive ebooks.

You can:

* Use any of the existing ebooks that are listed at the following link `here <http://runestoneinteractive.org/library.html>`_.
* Create a private custom course for your students as shown in the following link `custom-course <http://runestoneinteractive.org/customcourse.html>`_.  Your custom course will have to have a unique name and your students can register for the course using the unique name.

Additional Useful Links
:::::::::::::::::::::::

Runestone uses the ``restructuredText`` (rst) markup language.  We chose this over markdown largely because rst is extensible.  Nearly all of the basic markup tasks are already handled by restructuredText.  You should check out the docs for the basics of restructuredText (link below). Our extensions are all for the interactive elements.  One key hint about restructuredText:  Its like **Python** -- *indentation matters!*
