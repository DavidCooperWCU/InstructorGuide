Create a Custom Course
======================

As a teacher, you can make a custom course on the Runestone server out of an existing Runestone book. Your students will log in to your course, and then their activities will be tracked. You will then be able to:

* View summaries of student activity with particular questions or pages
* Assemble custom assignments and lab sessions from..

  * existing activities that are built into the book
  * new activities that you author yourself using a markup language

* Create a custom table of contents that reorders the chapters and sections of the book
