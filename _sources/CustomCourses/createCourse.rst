How to Create a Custom Course
-------------------------------------

1. Log in to the runestone server at `https://runestone.academy <https://runestone.academy>`_ if you already have an account with Runestone Interactive.  If you don't have an account then you can create one at `https://runestone.academy/runestone/default/user/register <https://runestone.academy/runestone/default/user/register>`_. When you register, it will ask to enter the name of an ebook.  You can enter the name for any of the existing ebooks.

Your students can register for your custom course by using the unique name that you used when you created your custom course when they register at `https://runestone.academy/runestone/default/user/register <https://runestone.academy/runestone/default/user/register>`_..  If they already have a login on Runestone Academy, they can simply add another course using the new course name by going to `https://runestone.academy/runestone/default/courses <https://runestone.academy/runestone/default/user/register>`_. and then clicking on "Add Another Course".
