Creating the Course
-------------------

1. Log in to the `runestone server <http://interactivepython.org>`_ using the account that you already created as a student for an existing course.

5. Fill out the form and click submit. Remember the Project name that you use; you will need to give that text string to your students.

6. At this point, you have to wait a while until it completes. For the SIGCSE 2017 workshop, to avoid delayes, we have pre-created a bunch of custom courses for each of the books, from a bunch of fake accounts. You can take over one of those accounts so you don't have to wait for a course to build.
