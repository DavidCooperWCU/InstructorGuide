There are two primary kinds of assignments.  **Reading Assignments** and **Problems.**   Reading assignments allow you to select whole chapters or parts of chapters for your students to read.  You can assign points to the reading assignment by tracking the number of activities they attempt in each subchapter.    Problem assignments are mainly for you to select short programming problems for the students to solve, but could also include short answer, multiple choice, etc.  Or even problems that you write yourself.  More on that later.


In either case the primary way you will add questions is through the tree picker interface

Creating a Reading Assignment
-----------------------------

Let's create a reading assignment and add a few sections for our students to read.  As you add sections you will see that are shown in a table under the Readings tab.

There are four things you can change for each section:

* # required - How many of the components on the page do you students need to do in order to get the points for this section.

* How many points for completing this section?

* Auto-grade - interaction means that the students have done something

* which to grade - first answer, best answer, or last answer


Creating a Problem Assignment
-----------------------------

Creating a problem assignment is similar.  You will most often use the tree picker, but you can also search for problems or write your own.   When selecting a problem if you click on the name of the problem the interface will display the problem on the page remind you what it is about.

Problems have a different set of configurations

* Points - how many points for this question

* Auto-grade -- options here are % correct, All or nothing, Interaction, or manual.

* which to grade -- Best Answer, first answer or last answer
