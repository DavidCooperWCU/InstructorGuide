<span class="type">Section</span> <span class="codenumber">1.1</span> <span class="title">The Runestone Philosophy</span>
</h3>
<div class="para" id="p-2">The primary reason that Runestone was created was to be an interactive eBook server that would motivate students to actually read and experiment with the content provided by the author.  This idea was born in my head in the fall of 2010 as I was suffering from a serious case of writers block while trying to work on a second edition of a paper textbook.  Why should textbooks be static?  Especially computer science textbooks!?  From this frustration I stopped working on the update and started trying to create an interactive computer science textbook.  My primary motivation was to make every example ‚Äúrunnable‚Äù and ‚Äúeditable‚Äù so that students could read code, run code, and then modify that code to see how it behaved differently with their changes.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-3">Having come to Luther College from the <a class="external" href="https://grouplens.org" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">GroupLens research group</code></a> and an internet startup company, I also knew the value of collecting data.  So I also set out to make sure that every action a student took within the textbook was captured.  I had no idea what we were going do with the data, but my intuition was that we could learn valuable lessons about <em class="emphasis">how</em> students were learning if we captured and analyzed enough data.  Collect the data first and then figure out how to make use of it later.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-4">Everything else you see about Runestone Academy today came later, and I‚Äôll cover more of that evolution in <a href="Introduction.html#a-brief-history" class="internal" title="Section 1.5: A Brief History of Runestone">Section¬†1.5</a>.  But the takeway is that for us the student experience is always foremost in our minds. Everything that you as an instructor can do with Runestone follows from that philosophy of collect the data first and then see what we can do with it.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-5">I had never heard of the term <dfn class="terminology">Learning Engineering</dfn> until the summer of 2021, but that is really what Runestone is and has always been about. <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_engineering" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Wikipedia defines Learning engineering as follows</code></a> <blockquote class="blockquote" id="blockquote-1">Learning Engineering is the systematic application of evidence-based principles and methods from educational technology and the learning sciences to create engaging and effective learning experiences, support the difficulties and challenges of learners as they learn, and come to better understand learners and learning. It emphasizes the use of a human-centered design approach in conjunction with analyses of rich data sets to iteratively develop and improve those designs to address specific learning needs, opportunities, and problems, often with the help of technology.</blockquote> Today (August 2022) if you asked me I would say that Runestone is a <abbr class="acronym">LEAP</abbr>.  A learning Engineering and Analytics Portal. Many of the innovative features in Runestone have come from first class pedagogical research.  All of Runestone has been evolved over the years by paying attention to the data we collect and the feedback we get from instructors and students.  All of this has been possible because we realized early on that most instructors do not want to run and manage their own servers, and that we could provide a valuable service by providing a portal to free, high quality interactive textbooks.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-6">The diagram below illustrates what we are trying to create.  Which is a virtuous circle whereby students learn more effectively, teachers can learn to teach more effectively, and authors can learn to write better textbooks.</div>
<div class="image-box" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;"><img src="external/VirtuousCircle.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div>
<div class="para" id="p-7">All of this is to say that although Runestone supports many of the functions of an LMS, Runestone was never designed to be an LMS. Runestone is much more, and in order for you as an instructor to get the most out of Runestone you may need to adjust your thinking and expectations.  Hopefully this guide will help you do that.</div></section><section class="section" id="section-2"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Section</span> <span class="codenumber">1.2</span> <span class="title">Courses Versus Books</span>
</h3>
<div class="para" id="p-8">The first thing to understand about Runestone is the difference between a book and a course.  This has long been a point of confusion.  Runestone was originally conceived of as a system for building interactive textbooks.  But, as soon as you start to include interactive things like coding and multiple choice questions the next logical step is for someone (likely you - dear reader) to want to evaluate that work and record a grade.  A grade only makes sense in the context of a course, so we created the ability for you to make a course for your students.  But because the central notion always was a book there has always been the limitation that a course can only be tied to a single book.  This limitation continues, but is something we are thinking about how to relax in the future. In the meantime <a href="chapter-3.html#custom-courses_how-to-create-a-custom-course" class="internal" title="Section 3.2: How to Create a course">Section¬†3.2</a> will guide you through the process of creating a course around your chosen textbook.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-9">The fact that Runestone allows you to do many of the things that you would normally do in an LMS like Canvas or Moodle has led many people to think of Runestone as an LMS like system.  We reject that label and claim that Runestone is much more than an LMS.  Runestone is a <abbr class="acronym">LEAP</abbr> Learning Engineering and Analytics Portal.  Briefly, Learning Engineering is ‚Äúis the systematic application of evidence-based principles and methods from educational technology and the learning sciences to create engaging and effective learning experiences, support the difficulties and challenges of learners as they learn, and come to better understand learners and learning.‚Äù See <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_engineering" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">this article for more.</code></a>
</div>
<div class="para" id="p-10">Because a book and a course are so tightly coupled  we can do many things that an LMS cannot.  We can collect much more fine-grained data about what your students are doing.  Your students can do their homework by answering questions as they read them in context, or they can answer them on a homework page that has only the questions.  In fact it does not matter where they do their work if they answer the question in one place it will also appear in the other.  Runestone captures every interaction your students have with a question whether they answer the question before you assign it or after its assigned or even long after a homework assignment is due we save that interaction and timestamp it.  This gives you a lot of flexibility over accepting late work (or not) For every question you can see the time of your students first interaction with that question as well as their last, you can see their entire history of interactions with that question.  For programming assignments this can be a powerful learning tool for both you and your student.</div></section><section class="section" id="section-3"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Section</span> <span class="codenumber">1.3</span> <span class="title">Privacy</span>
</h3>
<div class="para" id="p-11">In order to do  things like remember work in progress, record scores, etc. Runestone needs a student to have a persistent user id.  In 2022 we realize it is quite common to use one‚Äôs email address as that persistent identifier, but we do not.  We still use usernames so that you or your student can make up something completely disconnected from a students personal information.  In fact one can successfully use runestone with a random username, a fake email address, and a fake first and last name.  The only caveat to that is that if you forget your password you won‚Äôt be able to reset it with a fake email address!</div>
<div class="para" id="p-12">We urge you to read our <a class="external" href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/default/privacy.html" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Privacy Policy</code></a> and our <a class="external" href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/default/terms.html" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Terms of Service</code></a> We understand that in 2022 it is common, especially for high schools, to want us to sign a data privacy agreement. Please understand that as an open source project we do not have a lot of resources for reading legalese.  You can help a lot by looking at your data privacy policy and crossing out the part where it says that Runestone will reimburse your school in the event of a data breach.  You get to use Runestone for free, why should we be required to pay you for an event that we cannot fully control.  Major corporations and banks have breaches regularly.  The good news is that we really are not likely to be a target.  We just don‚Äôt store anything that valuable.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-13">One of the strengths of Runestone is that many of our features have been created and tested and validated by published research!  That is good news for your students.  It also means that we do cooperate with a small number of highly trusted research partners at major universities.  We give them access to fully de-identified data from our database to help them conduct experiements on new features.  This makes the experience better for everyone while keeping your student‚Äôs work anonymous.</div></section><section class="section" id="section-4"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

</h3>
<div class="para" id="p-14">Our mission is to make high quality textbooks available to all students for free.  But, servers cost money, development takes time and money.  One way that we support the mission of Runestone is to show ads to a some of our visitors.  Specifically we only show ads to people who have not created an account.  That means that the vast majority of ads are actually served to people who land on one of our pages because of a search.  Generally speaking these are not students in a class.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-15">If you want to make the ads go away it is easy, just create an account.  Don‚Äôt worry, we don‚Äôt sell your email address, or give away your name.  Feel free to use a fake email and fake name.  Although if you forget your password you won‚Äôt be able to reset it without a working email.  As an instructor you should read <a href="chapter-4.html#registration_privacy-and-runestone" class="internal" title="Section 4.2: Privacy and Runestone">Section¬†4.2</a> if you want to set your students up to use Runestone Academy anonymously.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-16">If every class that used Runestone could pay $100 for the semester regardless of the size of the class we would have enough money to be fully sustainable, and not show any ads to anyone.  We would love that.  We are not huge fans of ads either.  So maybe you can help us figure out how to do that.</div></section><section class="section" id="a-brief-history"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

</h3>
<div class="para" id="p-17">The Runestone project began in on my sabbatical in 2011.  I‚Äôve already mentioned that I had serious writers block because I wanted computer science textbooks to be interactive.  The first stage in fixing that problem was finding a way to run Python in the browser.  This led me to the <a class="external" href="https://skulpt.org" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Skulpt Project</code></a> Scottie Graham had implemented Python 2.6-ish by re-implementing CPython in Javascript.  While the core was there Skulpt was missing many pieces, such as a turtle graphics module.  Since I loved using turtle graphics as a way for students to get fun, immediate feedback on their code I set about trying to add turtle graphics to skulpt.  Since I knew very little about Javascript that sucked up a couple of months of my Sabbatical, but was a lot more fun than updating a textbook.  With turtle graphics in hand I knew I had hit on something!</div>
<div class="para" id="p-18">The next problem was that I knew that as an author I didn‚Äôt want to have to write a 100 lines of custom javascript for every example!  I needed a way, ideally a really simple way of just surrounding some python code with a wrapper and letting a tool build the html and javascript needed to create a widget on the webpage that ran the Python.  This led me to <a class="external" href="sphinx-doc.org" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Sphinx</code></a>  Sphinx is a wonderful writing tool, widely used in the Python community.  It also has a rich collection of extensions, and a syntax that is just what I was looking for!  With sphinx I could write something like:</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">.. activecode:: some_id

    print("hello world")
</pre>
<div class="para" id="p-19">Sphinx would turn that into html that looked like:</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">&lt;div class="runestone explainer ac_section "&gt;
&lt;div data-component="activecode" id=over_ac_example1 data-question_label="1.1.1"&gt;
&lt;div id=over_ac_example1_question class="ac_question col-md-12"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;textarea data-lang="python" id="over_ac_example1_editor" 
      data-timelimit=25000 data-coach="true" data-codelens="true"   
    data-audio=''      
           data-wasm=/_static
     style="visibility: hidden;"&gt;
print("My first program adds a list of numbers")
myList = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
total = 0
for num in myList:
    total = total + num
print(total)
&lt;/textarea&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
</pre>
<div class="para" id="p-20">Stir in some javascript and you have a working runnable example! That looks like this:</div>
<div class="ptx-runestone-container"><div class="runestone explainer ac_section "><div data-component="activecode" id="python-hello-world"><textarea data-lang="python" data-timelimit="25000" data-audio="" data-coach="true" style="visibility: hidden;" id="python-hello-world_editor" data-question_label="" data-codelens="true">print("My first program adds a list of numbers")
myList = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
total = 0
for num in myList:
    total = total + num
print(total)
</textarea></div></div></div>
<div class="para" id="p-21">With Sphinx I had a way to write large documents in a very simple markup language called <a class="external" href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">restructuredText</code></a> and a way to extend the markup with interactive textbook elements, which at that time was still only running python.  But it gave me a huge sense of optimism that my goal of having an interactive textbook was achievable.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-22">The next problem was to translate our textbook called <em class="emphasis">Python Programming in Context</em> from LaTeX to restructuredText and converting the examples to be runnable.  But Jones and Bartlett publishers had different ideas.  I had signed away the digital rights to the book in our original contract and Jones and Bartlett were not willing to let me convert the book.  They were going to sells PDFs along with some kind of digital code to a code practice system online.  I was really depressed, I loved that book and its approach.  I hated the publisher (and still do) for their greed and short sightedness.  I didn‚Äôt want to start over and write yet another intro to CS book from scratch.  So I started looking for something else to start with.  This led me to <a class="external" href="" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">How to Think like a Computer Scientist</code></a> by <a class="external" href="https://www.allendowney.com/wp/" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Allen Downey</code></a> and  <a class="external" href="https://www.elkner.net" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Jeffrey Elkner.</code></a>  This book at a GNU Free Documentation License, and was alread in restructuredText!!  So I remixed that book and added interactive examples which led to the interactive edition of that book.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-23">The publisher of My other book, <em class="emphasis">Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python</em> was <a class="external" href="https://fbeedle.com" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Franklin Beedle</code></a>.  I‚Äôll never forget the conversation I had with Jim Leisy, our publisher, at SIGCSE.  I had just given him a demo of a couple chapters of the interactive How to Think book and asked him if we could do the same thing with our data structures book.  He said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always wanted to change the world, and this looks like my chance, lets do it!‚Äù</div>
<div class="para" id="p-24">In the Summer of 2011 I was at the ACM Awards ceremony in San Jose, I was there as part of the team accepting the <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_Software_System_Award" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Software System award</code></a>.  At the banquet I started a conversation with Mark Guzdial and Barb Ericson who were accepting the Karl Karlstrom outstanding educator award.  I told them about Runestone and that conversation started a pivotal partnership that has lasted to this day.  Their reaction was this is wonderful and the kind of research tool we have been looking for.  Now can you add multiple choice questions? fill in the blank?  And many many more ideas including Parsons problems, which were the subject of Barb‚Äôs PhD research.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-25">The next several years were super busy, I managed to find money to get Luther students to work with me on Runestone during the summer months.  In the summer of 2014 we had the first Runestone Hackathon at the University of Michigan.  This workshop was pivotal because it was the beginning of the instructor interface.  I had always resisted adding too many instructor facing features to Runestone,  I did not want Runestone to become another crappy LMS!! But Paul Resnick and Barb Ericson convinced me that adding features to make the lives of instructors better was necessary, and that we could do things that LMS could never dream of doing to help teachers understand their students better.  We did a lot of whiteboard designing that year and worked on it until it all really came together in the summer of 2016 when we had the second hackathon at Luther College.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-26">By the late Fall of 2017 I was developing a real desire to focus all of my efforts on Runestone.  But I wasn‚Äôt sure how to make that happen until Luther announced an early retirement incentive. Anyone with 15 years of service to the college was eligible and could get a years salary and stay on the college health plan for five years.  This was a dream come true, I just met the 15 year criteria and the years salary would give me time to figure out how to make Runestone sustainble in a way that could pay me some kind of salary.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-27">Things got even more interesting in the Spring of 2018 when I was offered a consulting gig with Google.  They wanted to use Runestone as a platform for their applied computing program.  In a nutshell the program‚Äôs goals were to introduce computer science to colleges with underserved student populations that had not offered computer science before.  I basically got to work on Runestone and coach professors from the participating colleges in how to use Runestone and how to teach introductory CS.  The program expanded into a second course to introduce Data Science to those colleges, which resulted in the <em class="emphasis">How to Think like a Data Scientist</em> book.  My gig at Google was supposed to last 5 months, but it ended up lasting two years.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-28">Sometime in the early2019 I received an email from Oscar Levin that read as follows</div>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">On behalf of the workshop organizers, Jim Fowler, Mitch Keller, Matthew
Leingang, and Oscar Levin, we would like to invite you to participate
in the workshop
"Interactive assessments in open source textbooks"
from December 9 to December 13, 2019.
</pre>
<div class="para" id="p-29">I didn‚Äôt know anything about <abbr class="acronym">AIM</abbr>, and I had never met Oscar but the workshop sounded interesting. So I said yes. When I arrived at the first day of the workshop and listened to the introductory talk, I knew that I had found a group of people I wanted to work with more.  Many of the people in this workshop were authors of open source math textbooks written in <a class="external" href="https://pretextbook.org" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">PreTeXt</code></a>.  A project started by Rob Beezer at about the same time I had started Runestone.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-30">It was early in the afternoon of the first day of the workshop when I found myself in a room with David Farmer, and after I had given a quick demonstration of Runestone and its capabilities he said something like:  ‚ÄúThis is great, but I don‚Äôt know why you would want to keep developing this Runestone Markup language when you could just use PreTeXt and focus your efforts on other more valuable work.‚Äù  It was one of those direct statements that hit me hard, should I be offended? embarrased? honored?  It took me a couple of days and getting to know both David and Rob better to realize the wisdom of that statement.  But by the end of the workshop we were able to host a version of Rob‚Äôs book <em class="emphasis">A First Course in Linear Algebra</em> on a Runestone Server.  We also realized that our goals were very well aligned and that we could accomplish more by working together than we could by continuing to work separately.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-31">It took an entire global pandemic for Rob and I to really integrate the Runestone Components into PreTeXt.  And it took me a Summer to cook up a conversion process that turned restructuredText into PreTeXt.  But that explains why this instructor guide looks a bit different than the Runestone books you may be used to seeing.  I converted the instructor guide to PreTeXt and have been working on adding it and making it more useful.  What you see in this book is a little glimpse of the future.  Whats more is that students really benefit from this partnership.  Books in PreTeXt are far more accessible than anything we have done with restructuredText and they are far more mobile ready as well.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-32">Building a system like Runestone is a lot of work, and I am amazed at what we have accomplished with very little funding.  The future looks very exciting Runestone Academy has incorporated and is operating as a non-profit.  We have applied for and are waiting approval of the formal 501(c)(3) tax status with the IRS. I am hopeful that I will be able to announce some significant support from an NSF program designed to help open source projects like Runestone and PreTeXt become sustainable long term.  I think I did a pretty good job of outlining our vision in <a href="Introduction.html#prose-philosophy" class="internal" title="Section 1.1: The Runestone Philosophy">Section¬†1.1</a>. We have an exciting and necessary mission and if you are inspired to help us out in any way we would welcome your efforts!</div></section><section class="section" id="faq"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

</h4>
<div class="para" id="p-53">In my years of teaching computer science I was always learning something new and trying to stay ahead of the students. I understand that for many of you this might be a first time teaching a CS course, and that for many you are overworked and underpaid. I hear you, and I feel your pain.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-54">But just as I tell my students, you can‚Äôt really learn this stuff just by reading the answer, you have to do it.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-55">We have many books on Runestone Academy written by many authors. Whether or not authors provide an instructor guide or answers to all the questions is up to them. So there is no blanket answer to the question.</div>
<div class="para" id="p-56">For myself there are several reasons:</div>
<div class="para logical" id="p-57"><ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-16"><div class="para" id="p-58">Writing an instructor guide that contains all of the answers to the questions essentially doubles the work of writing a book, and even more so maintaining the book. In all the textbooks I‚Äôve used over the years for CS I‚Äôve only ever had one that had a solution guide and that was largely for all of the math in a networking text.</div></li>
<li id="li-17"><div class="para" id="p-59">For 99% of the questions there is no one right answer. Very likely if I give you an answer there is a better one out there, and I really don‚Äôt want to get into arguments about what is better. Especially since a lot of it comes down to style.</div></li>
<li id="li-18"><div class="para" id="p-60">Doing the work is the best way to prepare to teach it. You are smarter, wiser, and a better problem solver than your students. Its actually good for them to see how you approach solving the problem rather consulting some answer key.</div></li>
<li id="li-19"><div class="para" id="p-61">From a practical perspective it would be very hard for me to decide who gets the materials. How do I know you are an instructor? I can‚Äôt possibly take the time to go check out every user that claims to be an instructor to see if they are legit. Right now the only benefit of being an instructor is that you get to see and grade the work of your students. If you are a student pretending to be an instructor this gives you no advantage.</div></li>
<li id="li-20"><div class="para" id="p-62">As I think about how best to invest the hours of my day that I have to work on this, I have very little energy or excitement for writing an answer key. So I choose to spend my time elsewhere. If others were to do so, and want to publish it somehow, I would be very happy to accept a PR!</div></li>
<li id="li-21"><div class="para" id="p-63">I wold much rather put my energy into developing good unit tests, so that you know when you are right and when you are not there yet without me giving you solution.</div></li>
<li id="li-22"><div class="para" id="p-64">With all of that, behind me, I‚Äôm still thinking about it, and trying to find a way to do it where its NOT a huge amount of extra work, and I can keep things in sync. I‚Äôve thought about charging for the instructor guide as one way to both disuade casual cheaters and to help fund Runestone development. Stay tuned‚Ä¶</div></li>

<div class="para" id="p-88">There are many answers to this, as the question itself is very vague. Where is it not showing up? What is not showing up? The first thing to say is that Runestone goes to great lengths to save everything! It is extremely rare for an action to go unrecorded. With that said here are things to check.</div>
<div class="para logical" id="p-89"><ol class="decimal">
<li id="li-33"><div class="para" id="p-90">Make sure your students are logged in to YOUR course and not the open course that you based yours on. If your student is logged in to your course they will see the name of your course in the upper left corner of the browser window.</div></li>
<li id="li-34"><div class="para" id="p-91">Make sure they are paying attention to the progress bar. If the progress bar is gray they are not logged in! If it is green they are. The progress bar will show how many of their activities have been recorded for that page.</div></li>
<li id="li-35"><div class="para" id="p-92">Check the assignment page and click on the self grade button. This is yet another way that students can verify their work has been saved.</div></li>
<li id="li-36"><div class="para" id="p-93">For students work to show up in the gradebook you will need to use the grading interface to run the autograder which tabulates the scores for the assignment and saves them in the database. You also need to release the grades in order for the students to see them on the student progress page. If you haven‚Äôt released them then they will not see their progress.</div></li>
<li id="li-37"><div class="para" id="p-94">Make sure your assignment deadlines are set up correctly or that you have unchecked the box to only count activities before the deadline.</div></li>
<li id="li-38"><div class="para" id="p-95">From the student progress page you can click on the name of any student and see the raw log details. You can also click on the overview reports link from that page and download a CSV file that you can import into your favorite spreadsheet.

</h4>
<div class="para" id="p-115">Ok, this is a question that has the potential to start nasty religious wars. The technical answer is that this book uses a version of Python called <a class="external" href="http://skulpt.org" target="_blank">Skulpt</a><a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl original" data-refid="hk-fn-11" id="fn-11"><sup>‚Äâ11‚Äâ</sup></a>. It is entirely written in Javascript so that it runs right in the browser. We think this is very cool. Now some people get all crazy about whether they should teach Python 3 or Python 2. The truth is that for CS1 and CS2 it really does not matter. Skulpt can do print with or without parenthesis, and / can do true division or integer division and lets face it for CS1 that is really all that matters. Sure, there are differences, but are you really going to start out by teaching your students about dict_keys and how they are different from a list. If so, I think you are cruel and you should teach your students APL. If you want to slant your teaching toward Python 3, you can do that with this book. If you want to lean towards 2, you can do that too. When you build your course there is a configuration parameter that lets you choose Python3, this forces you to use parenthesis when you print, and it makes python / default to true division, and // to integer division.</div></section><section class="subsection" id="_i-think-there-is-a-bug-in-your-book-what-should-i-do"><h4 class="heading hide-type">

</h4>
<div class="para" id="p-130">Very well thank you!  Every student interaction is logged to the runestone database using UTC time.  When you create an assignment with a deadline store the time in the timezone of the instructor making the assignment as the deadline.  Given that we can fairly judge whether a student has completed their work on time.  Trust me we have figured this out over the years and learned a lot about time zones.  Did you know there are places in the world where there are half or quarter hour differences between two timezones??!!</div>
<div class="para" id="p-131">I realize that students will often complain that they had their work done on time but the darn Runestone would not give them credit.  Usually they are wrong.  But you have several ways of checking out their claim including downloading the log for your course or looking at the Student Activity report and checking their first and last interactions with the problem. The software has proven itself to be correct way more often than the students and we use one of the most reliable databases in the world (Postgresql) to keep track of student activities!</div></section></section></section><div class="hidden-content tex2jax_ignore" id="hk-fn-1"><div class="fn"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/instructorguide/frontmatter-1.html?mode=browsing</code></div></div>
