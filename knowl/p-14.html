<div class="para">Our mission is to make high quality textbooks available to all students for free.  But, servers cost money, development takes time and money.  One way that we support the mission of Runestone is to show ads to a some of our visitors.  Specifically we only show ads to people who have not created an account.  That means that the vast majority of ads are actually served to people who land on one of our pages because of a search.  Generally speaking these are not students in a class.</div>
