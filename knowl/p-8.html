<div class="para">The first thing to understand about Runestone is the difference between a book and a course.  This has long been a point of confusion.  Runestone was originally conceived of as a system for building interactive textbooks.  But, as soon as you start to include interactive things like coding and multiple choice questions the next logical step is for someone (likely you - dear reader) to want to evaluate that work and record a grade.  A grade only makes sense in the context of a course, so we created the ability for you to make a course for your students.  But because the central notion always was a book there has always been the limitation that a course can only be tied to a single book.  This limitation continues, but is something we are thinking about how to relax in the future. In the meantime <a href="chapter-3.html#custom-courses_how-to-create-a-custom-course" class="internal" title="Section 3.2: How to Create a course">SectionÂ 3.2</a> will guide you through the process of creating a course around your chosen textbook.</div>
