As your students interact with the book, the book and the server work together to capture the clicks, the answers to questions, the code your students write, etc. All of this is captured <em class="emphasis">regardless of whether the activities are part of an assignment.</em> When you make an assignment that is a layer on top of all of the data collection that simply tells the software what actions to group together when you want to assign a grade.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">The separation of data collection from assignments can be a bit confusing at first. It has important implications that you should understand.</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">If you use the same question in multiple assignments the student only has to do the work once.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If you delete an assignment, your students do not lose any work.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">There is no need for your students to “submit” an assignment. When it comes time to grade the software simply uses the data collected for each of the questions in the assignment.</div></li>
