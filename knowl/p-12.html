<div class="para">We urge you to read our <a class="external" href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/default/privacy.html" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Privacy Policy</code></a> and our <a class="external" href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/default/terms.html" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Terms of Service</code></a> We understand that in 2022 it is common, especially for high schools, to want us to sign a data privacy agreement. Please understand that as an open source project we do not have a lot of resources for reading legalese.  You can help a lot by looking at your data privacy policy and crossing out the part where it says that Runestone will reimburse your school in the event of a data breach.  You get to use Runestone for free, why should we be required to pay you for an event that we cannot fully control.  Major corporations and banks have breaches regularly.  The good news is that we really are not likely to be a target.  We just donâ€™t store anything that valuable.</div>
