<div class="para">I had never heard of the term <dfn class="terminology">Learning Engineering</dfn> until the summer of 2021, but that is really what Runestone is and has always been about. <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_engineering" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Wikipedia defines Learning engineering as follows</code></a> <blockquote class="blockquote">Learning Engineering is the systematic application of evidence-based principles and methods from educational technology and the learning sciences to create engaging and effective learning experiences, support the difficulties and challenges of learners as they learn, and come to better understand learners and learning. It emphasizes the use of a human-centered design approach in conjunction with analyses of rich data sets to iteratively develop and improve those designs to address specific learning needs, opportunities, and problems, often with the help of technology.</blockquote> Today (August 2022) if you asked me I would say that Runestone is a <abbr class="acronym">LEAP</abbr>.  A learning Engineering and Analytics Portal. Many of the innovative features in Runestone have come from first class pedagogical research.  All of Runestone has been evolved over the years by paying attention to the data we collect and the feedback we get from instructors and students.  All of this has been possible because we realized early on that most instructors do not want to run and manage their own servers, and that we could provide a valuable service by providing a portal to free, high quality interactive textbooks.</div>
