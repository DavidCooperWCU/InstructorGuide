<div class="para">The primary reason that Runestone was created was to be an interactive eBook server that would motivate students to actually read and experiment with the content provided by the author.  This idea was born in my head in the fall of 2010 as I was suffering from a serious case of writers block while trying to work on a second edition of a paper textbook.  Why should textbooks be static?  Especially computer science textbooks!?  From this frustration I stopped working on the update and started trying to create an interactive computer science textbook.  My primary motivation was to make every example “runnable” and “editable” so that students could read code, run code, and then modify that code to see how it behaved differently with their changes.</div>
