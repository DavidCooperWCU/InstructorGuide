<div class="para">Because a book and a course are so tightly coupled  we can do many things that an LMS cannot.  We can collect much more fine-grained data about what your students are doing.  Your students can do their homework by answering questions as they read them in context, or they can answer them on a homework page that has only the questions.  In fact it does not matter where they do their work if they answer the question in one place it will also appear in the other.  Runestone captures every interaction your students have with a question whether they answer the question before you assign it or after its assigned or even long after a homework assignment is due we save that interaction and timestamp it.  This gives you a lot of flexibility over accepting late work (or not) For every question you can see the time of your students first interaction with that question as well as their last, you can see their entire history of interactions with that question.  For programming assignments this can be a powerful learning tool for both you and your student.</div>
