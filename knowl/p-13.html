<div class="para">One of the strengths of Runestone is that many of our features have been created and tested and validated by published research!  That is good news for your students.  It also means that we do cooperate with a small number of highly trusted research partners at major universities.  We give them access to fully de-identified data from our database to help them conduct experiements on new features.  This makes the experience better for everyone while keeping your studentâ€™s work anonymous.</div>
