<div class="para">In order to do  things like remember work in progress, record scores, etc. Runestone needs a student to have a persistent user id.  In 2022 we realize it is quite common to use one’s email address as that persistent identifier, but we do not.  We still use usernames so that you or your student can make up something completely disconnected from a students personal information.  In fact one can successfully use runestone with a random username, a fake email address, and a fake first and last name.  The only caveat to that is that if you forget your password you won’t be able to reset it with a fake email address!</div>
