<div class="para">Having come to Luther College from the <a class="external" href="https://grouplens.org" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">GroupLens research group</code></a> and an internet startup company, I also knew the value of collecting data.  So I also set out to make sure that every action a student took within the textbook was captured.  I had no idea what we were going do with the data, but my intuition was that we could learn valuable lessons about <em class="emphasis">how</em> students were learning if we captured and analyzed enough data.  Collect the data first and then figure out how to make use of it later.</div>
