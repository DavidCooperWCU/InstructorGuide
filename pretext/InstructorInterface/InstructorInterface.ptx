  <title>The Instructor Interface</title>

  <p>One of the primary goals of the Runestone Instructor Interface is to help you understand where your students are at, and to help you to prepare and make the best use of classtime.  We set out to create an interface where you could see at a glance which concepts your students clearly <q>got</q> and which concepts they were struggling with so that you can spend your valuable class time on the topics that were confusing rather than boring them by covering material they clearly understand.  To really be effective with this strategy you should use reading assignments as described in <xref ref="instructor-interface_assignments" />.
