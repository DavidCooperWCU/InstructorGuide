      <li>
        <p>Answering a multiple choice question</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Answering a mixed-up code (Parsons) problem</p>
      </li>

    <title>Chapter Progress</title>
    <p>One very easy to use report that allows you to quickly see how much work your students are doing on each page is the Chapter Progress Report. It looks like this:</p>
    <figure align="center">
      <image source="Figures/chapter_progress.png" width="800px%"/>
    </figure>
    <p>It can quickly show you the number of elements on each page that your students have interacted with. The dropdown menu gives you other options such viewing the first time a student interacted with an element, the last time a student interacted with the element, and an overview of the number of times a student has interacted. You can also filter by chapter or any other search criteria using the popup menu on the chapter_label column. Just experiement a bit.</p>
    <p>The numbers in each cell are clickable so you can drill down into a particular page for a particular student to see what they have done and the number of interactions with each element.</p>
    <figure align="center">
      <image source="Figures/activity_drilldown.png" width="800px%"/>
    </figure>
    <p>You can even click the view button to see a preview of the activity. Clicking on the Question link will bring you the summary page for that activity where you can see an aggregate of how all students performed on that question. We'll see more about that report shortly.</p>

    <title>Student Progress Tab</title>
    <p>The instructor interface lets you see summaries of some of these activities that may be useful to you. To get started, from the instructor interface, click on the <em>Student Progress</em> tab.</p>

        <li>
          <p>If you have assigned students to read a particular chapter prior to (or after) class, you can see at a glance what percentage of them have looked at each of the pages in a chapter. In the upper right hand corner, you can select a chapter. Then look at the left side.</p>

          <p>You can see how students did on the multiple choice problems in the chapter. Some instructors have found it useful to focus in class on those questions where many students got the question wrong initially. Currently, the interface sorts the questions in order of the percentage of students who got them right the first time, so you may want to scroll down to find the ones they had trouble with.</p>

      <p>This page is further drilldown on an individual question. You can see a histogram of the number of attempts made on the question across the class, you can see the frequency with which each option was selected, and you can see the first four responses of each student. You can also see a preview of the question.</p>
