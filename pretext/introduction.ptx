Welcome to the Runestone Academy instructor interface.  This guide will try to help you navigate the various tasks that you can do with Runestone.  Your first question might be what are those tasks?
<ul>
<li>Create a Course</li>
<li>Add and remove students</li>
<li>Add and remove TAs or co-instructors</li>
<li>Create homework assignments</li>
<li>Grade the homework assignments</li>
<li>Prepare for class by understanding where my students are confused</li>
<li>Configure the spaced practice tool for my students</li>
<li>Prepare an assessment for my students to take online with Runestone</li>
<li>Use Peer Instruction during class</li>
<li>Configure Runestone to work with Canvas or Moodle</li>
</ul>
While that is a long list of things that you <em>can do</em> there is very little that you <em>must do.</em>  Many instructors use Runestone Academy very minimally at first and then do more the next time.

<title>The Runestone Philosophy</title>
<p>The primary reason that Runestone was created was to be an interactive eBook server that would motivate students to actually read and experiment with the content provided by the author.  This idea was born in my head in the fall of 2010 as I was suffering from a serious case of writers block while trying to work on a second edition of a paper textbook.  Why should textbooks be static?  Especially computer science textbooks!?  From this frustration I stopped working on the update and started trying to create an interactive computer science textbook.  My primary motivation was to make every example <q>runnable</q> and <q>editable</q> so that students could read code, run code, and then modify that code to see how it behaved differently with their changes.</p>
<p>Having come to Luther College from the <url href="https://grouplens.org" visual="GroupLens research group" /> and an internet startup company, I also knew the value of collecting data.  So I also set out to make sure that every action a student took within the textbook was captured.  I had no idea what we were going do with the data, but my intuition was that we could learn valuable lessons about <em>how</em> students were learning if we captured and analyzed enough data.  Collect the data first and then figure out how to make use of it later.</p>

<p>Everything else you see about Runestone Academy today came later, and I'll cover more of that evolution in <xref ref="a-brief-history" />.  But the takeway is that for us the student experience is always foremost in our minds. Everything that you as an instructor can do with Runestone follows from that philosophy of collect the data first and then see what we can do with it.</p>  
<p>I had never heard of the term <term>Learning Engineering</term> until the summer of 2021, but that is really what Runestone is and has always been about. <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_engineering" visual="Wikipedia defines Learning engineering as follows"/> <blockquote>Learning Engineering is the systematic application of evidence-based principles and methods from educational technology and the learning sciences to create engaging and effective learning experiences, support the difficulties and challenges of learners as they learn, and come to better understand learners and learning. It emphasizes the use of a human-centered design approach in conjunction with analyses of rich data sets to iteratively develop and improve those designs to address specific learning needs, opportunities, and problems, often with the help of technology.</blockquote>
 Today (August 2022) if you asked me I would say that Runestone is a <acro>LEAP</acro>.  A learning Engineering and Analytics Portal. Many of the innovative features in Runestone have come from first class pedagogical research.  All of Runestone has been evolved over the years by paying attention to the data we collect and the feedback we get from instructors and students.  All of this has been possible because we realized early on that most instructors do not want to run and manage their own servers, and that we could provide a valuable service by providing a portal to free, high quality interactive textbooks.</p> 
 
 <p>The diagram below illustrates what we are trying to create.  Which is a virtuous circle whereby students learn more effectively, teachers can learn to teach more effectively, and authors can learn to write better textbooks.</p>
 <image source="VirtuousCircle.svg" width="70%"/>
 <p>All of this is to say that although Runestone supports many of the functions of an LMS, Runestone was never designed to be an LMS. Runestone is much more, and in order for you as an instructor to get the most out of Runestone you may need to adjust your thinking and expectations.  Hopefully this guide will help you do that.</p>

<title>Courses Versus Books</title>
<p>
The first thing to understand about Runestone is the difference between a book and a course.  This has long been a point of confusion.  Runestone was originally conceived of as a system for building interactive textbooks.  But, as soon as you start to include interactive things like coding and multiple choice questions the next logical step is for someone (likely you - dear reader) to want to evaluate that work and record a grade.  A grade only makes sense in the context of a course, so we created the ability for you to make a course for your students.  But because the central notion always was a book there has always been the limitation that a course can only be tied to a single book.  This limitation continues, but is something we are thinking about how to relax in the future. In the meantime <xref ref="custom-courses_how-to-create-a-custom-course" /> will guide you through the process of creating a course around your chosen textbook.
</p>

<p>
The fact that Runestone allows you to do many of the things that you would normally do in an LMS like Canvas or Moodle has led many people to think of Runestone as an LMS like system.  We reject that label and claim that Runestone is much more than an LMS.  Runestone is a <acro>LEAP</acro> Learning Engineering and Analytics Portal.  Briefly, Learning Engineering is <q>is the systematic application of evidence-based principles and methods from educational technology and the learning sciences to create engaging and effective learning experiences, support the difficulties and challenges of learners as they learn, and come to better understand learners and learning. </q> See <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_engineering" visual="this article for more."/>  
</p>
<p>
Because a book and a course are so tightly coupled  we can do many things that an LMS cannot.  We can collect much more fine-grained data about what your students are doing.  Your students can do their homework by answering questions as they read them in context, or they can answer them on a homework page that has only the questions.  In fact it does not matter where they do their work if they answer the question in one place it will also appear in the other.  Runestone captures every interaction your students have with a question whether they answer the question before you assign it or after its assigned or even long after a homework assignment is due we save that interaction and timestamp it.  This gives you a lot of flexibility over accepting late work (or not) For every question you can see the time of your students first interaction with that question as well as their last, you can see their entire history of interactions with that question.  For programming assignments this can be a powerful learning tool for both you and your student.

<title>Privacy</title>
<p>
In order to do  things like remember work in progress, record scores, etc. Runestone needs a student to have a persistent user id.  In 2022 we realize it is quite common to use one's email address as that persistent identifier, but we do not.  We still use usernames so that you or your student can make up something completely disconnected from a students personal information.  In fact one can successfully use runestone with a random username, a fake email address, and a fake first and last name.  The only caveat to that is that if you forget your password you won't be able to reset it with a fake email address!
</p>
<p>
We urge you to read our <url href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/default/privacy.html" visual="Privacy Policy" /> and our <url href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/default/terms.html" visual="Terms of Service" /> 

We understand that in 2022 it is common, especially for high schools, to want us to sign a data privacy agreement. Please understand that as an open source project we do not have a lot of resources for reading legalese.  You can help a lot by looking at your data privacy policy and crossing out the part where it says that Runestone will reimburse your school in the event of a data breach.  You get to use Runestone for free, why should we be required to pay you for an event that we cannot fully control.  Major corporations and banks have breaches regularly.  The good news is that we really are not likely to be a target.  We just don't store anything that valuable.
</p>

<p>
One of the strengths of Runestone is that many of our features have been created and tested and validated by published research!  That is good news for your students.  It also means that we do cooperate with a small number of highly trusted research partners at major universities.  We give them access to fully de-identified data from our database to help them conduct experiements on new features.  This makes the experience better for everyone while keeping your student's work anonymous.

<title>Why am I seeing Ads</title>
<p>Our mission is to make high quality textbooks available to all students for free.  But, servers cost money, development takes time and money.  One way that we support the mission of Runestone is to show ads to a some of our visitors.  Specifically we only show ads to people who have not created an account.  That means that the vast majority of ads are actually served to people who land on one of our pages because of a search.  Generally speaking these are not students in a class.</p>

<p>If you want to make the ads go away it is easy, just create an account.  Don't worry, we don't sell your email address, or give away your name.  Feel free to use a fake email and fake name.  Although if you forget your password you won't be able to reset it without a working email.  As an instructor you should read <xref ref="registration_privacy-and-runestone"/> if you want to set your students up to use Runestone Academy anonymously.</p>

<p>If every class that used Runestone could pay $100 for the semester regardless of the size of the class we would have enough money to be fully sustainable, and not show any ads to anyone.  We would love that.  We are not huge fans of ads either.  So maybe you can help us figure out how to do that.</p>
