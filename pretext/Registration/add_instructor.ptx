<title>Add and Instructor or TA</title>
<p>Runestone supports multiple instructors or TAs for a course.  We do not make any real distinction between a TA and an instructor so keep in mind they they both have all of the same privileges that you do.  Adding a another instructor is quite easy.  The process is as follows.

<ol>
<li>Make sure that your co-instructor has registered for your course as a student.</li>
<li><p>Go to the instructor page and select the Add TA tab as shown below</p>
<image source="Figures/add_instructor.png" description="Add a TA or instructor" />
</li>
<li>Select the co-instructor or TA from the list of students on the right then click the + button below the list.  You should see the name appear in the list of instructors on the left.</li>
</ol>

<p>To "demote" a co-instructor or TA back to a student just select them in the list of instructors on the left and click the - button below the box.</p>
