  <title>Register for a Course</title>
  <introduction>
  <p>There are two kinds of courses on Runestone Academy:
  <ul>
  <li>Courses that are open to anyone to view without logging in or for anyone to enroll in if they choose to create an account.  We call these books <term>base courses.</term> These courses are very large and have no instructor to guide the students, eveyone just proceeds at their own pace.</li>
  <li>Smaller courses at a a high school, college, or university, that are guided by an instructor like yourself also use these books.  We often refer to these as <term>custom courses</term></li>
  </ul>
  You can think of the base courses as a template for custom courses, something like classes and instances in object oriented programming.
  </p>
  <p>Although the base course books are open to the public, to save your work, you will need to register for an account on Runestone Academy. When you first regigister you will have the privileges of a <term>student.</term>  You do not become an <term>instructor</term> until your create your own course.  Lets walk through the registration process now.</p>

The form is pretty self-explanatory, except for the <em>Course Name</em> field. There is information about that on the right side. You can specify one of the strings that identify one of the public courses that the server knows about: thinkcspy, pythonds, etc.  Or you can enter the string for a course that someone else has created and provided you with.</p>
