<li>
<title>Term Start Date</title>
<p>You can change your course start date.  This is important if you copy assignments from a past term. Runestone will try to make the assignment due the same number of days from the start of the term.  We also do analysis of student performance based on the week of the course, so it helps our analysis if this date is accurate.</p></li>

<li>
<title>Enable ActiveCode Downloads</title> 
<p>If this box is checked then each activecode will have a download button that will allow your students to download a text file with the appropriate extension containing the code in the editor.</p></li>

<li>
<title>Allow Pairs</title>
<p>This enables a simple pair programming feature that allows a student to type in the username of a partner.  When the student clicks the Save and Run button the code will be saved for both students with a comment added that indicates they were working with a partner and who that partner was.</p></li>

<li>
<title>Enable Compare Me Button</title>
<p>Questions such as multiple choice may let students see how they did compared to other students in the class.  This button pops up a dialog that shows the percent of students that answered a question for each option. For a fill in the blank question it shows the top 10 answers.</p></li>
