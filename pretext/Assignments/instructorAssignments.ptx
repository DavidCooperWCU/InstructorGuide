  <title>Assignments</title>

  <p>Runestone supports two different kinds of assignments.  <term>Reading Assignments</term> and <term>Problem Sets</term>.  Understanding the difference between these two kinds of assignments is very important so lets discuss each before moving on to creating assignments.</p>

  <title>Reading Assignments</title>
  <p>
  In Runestone, a reading assignment is by design a formative exercise, low stakes activities to encourage your students to prepare and help them learn.  They are not meant to evaluate their progress. As such points are based on the students interaction with the textbook regardless of correctness.  Points are assigned based on the number of interactive activities on each page.  One activity is simply opening the page.  Other activities are based on answering questions or running programs or trying out visualizations that are in on each page.  The grading is set up to be all or nothing for each page.  If a student interacts with roughly 80% of the activities on the page they will get full credit. If they do not then they get zero points. You can change that threshold to be whatever you want when you are setting up the assignment.  It is worth repeating that they get credit for <em>interacting</em> with each thing not for getting it right.</p>
  <p>When you create a reading assignment it will appear on the Assignments page, and each page of the reading assignment will have a link to the next page in the assignment.  This allows you to encourage your students to read the pages in the order you choose rather than the order they appear in the book.</p>

  <title>Problem Sets</title>
  <p>
  In Runestone a problem set is a group of exercises that are graded for correctness.  These can be programming problems, fill in the blank questions, multiple choice or any other gradeable activity.  The problems may come from anywhere.  
  <ul>
  <li>The body of the text</li>
  <li>From exercises at the end of the chapter</li>
  <li>Problems that you create yourself</li>
  <li>Problems from a question bank or from another book</li>  
  </ul>
  When you create a problem set the problems appear on the assignment page and the student can either work on them there or in the context of the book.   To the Runestone system it does not matter where they work on the problem, just that they do work on the problem.</p>

  <title>Assignment Status</title>
  <p>
  The assignment page shows the status of the assignment.  Students are encouraged to use this to keep themselves organized.  They can mark an assignment as <term>in progress</term> or <term>submitted</term>  But marking an assignment as submitted is advisory only.  They can continue to work on the assignment and Runestone will continue to record what they do.  When you grade the assignment you then have the flexibility to decide what to grade in terms of when it was done.
